Main Question:
Can you tell me how we can reverse words in string 'I am a boy'?

Ideal Answer:
#### Strategy
Two Pointers.

#### Explanation
First, the algorithm splits the words of the sentence from a string into an array.\
The algorithm also initializes low and high pointers as the first and last indexes of the array.\
Then, the algorithm iterates the array.

For each iteration, the algorithm swaps the words at the low and high pointers,\
increments and decrements the low and high pointers respectively,\
and repeats until the low pointer is greater than the high pointer.

The result is all words of the sentence reversed in the array.\
The words are joined as a string again with a single space separating the words, and the string is returned.

##### Time Complexity
The algorithm updates the low and high pointers a number of times proportional to the number of words. \
Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of words.

##### Space Complexity
The algorithm splits the words from a sentence into an array. The array is auxiliary space and has length equal to the number of words.\
Therefore, the auxiliary space complexity of the algorithm is O(n).
